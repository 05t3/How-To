# Installing Samba on Ubuntu 21.10 Server

Fire up your terminal and update packages

`sudo apt update -y`

To install Samba, run the following command

`sudo apt install samba`

We can check if the installation was successful by running:

`whereis sammba`

The output should be almost similar

```python
root@practice:/home/user# whereis samba
samba: /usr/sbin/samba /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/samba /etc/samba /usr/share/samba /usr/share/man/man8/samba.8.gz /usr/share/man/man7/samba.7.gz
root@practice:/home/user#
```
